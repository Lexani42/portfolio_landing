Hi! I'd like to add portfolio for my personal brand as a devops engineer
What I need to have is a landing page that contains:
1. Hooking start of page
2. "About me" section
3. Contacts and form to contact me
All this should be on one page(!!!)
Please act as a CTO and choose stack to implement this idea
I guess it can be Next.js and Tailwind
